This code is part of the Code uploaded for the publication Meigel, F.J., Darwent, T., Bastin, L. et al. Dispersive transport dynamics in porous media emerge from local correlations. Nat Commun 13, 5885 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33485-5.

To simulate dispersive spread through a porous medium run "driver_dispersion_porous_spread2.m" in matlab 2022a.

Note, that a network file needs to be loaded in the "driver_dispersion_porous_spread2.m".
